# TEAM PROJECT DESCRIPTION

## OVERVIEW

> For many residents in Northern Ontario living in remote areas, it is difficult to get medication from regional hospitals. The hospital needs a system to take care of these residents.

## FUNCTIONALITIES

* A remote resident can **register** in this system and **upload** her/his health information.
* The system can **automatically upload** real-time health information obtained from sensors or other medical devices when the remote resident uses this system.
* When the remote resident has health problems, the system can **suggest** specific doctors take the case of them.
* By permission, a doctor can access residents’ health information.
* Hospitals, doctors and nurses can register this system as medication providers.
* The doctor can **give instructions** about health care to the remote resident through the system.
* In case the remote resident needs emergency care, the system **alarm** the hospital immediately.
* Older residents have **priorities** to obtain this system’s services.
* The system will **keep the privacy** and security for all of the medical information
